The internet provides you with an endless supply of content to kill time on

My choice of poisons are Reddit and Youtube but this cannot go on, so it's time to make it a bit incomvinient to get on those sites

```shell
    nuke@mistborn ~/VASSAL-3.2.15 $ cat /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1 localhost
    127.0.1.1 mistborn
    1.1.1.1 reddit.com
    1.1.1.1 youtube.com
```
